# Signature-App
Simple and minimalist signature app with drawing, color selection, and image saving features.

This app allows users to draw signatures, choose colors, adjust line width, and save their work as images. The app features options for clearing the canvas, saving the signature to local storage, and retrieving previously saved signatures. Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project demonstrates basic canvas manipulation and local storage usage.
